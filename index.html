      Full Stack Development refers to the process of developing both the
      frontend (what users see) and backend (server, database, logic) parts of a
      web application. A full stack developer is skilled in technologies like
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js, Python, PHP, or Java
      for the backend. They also work with databases like MySQL or MongoDB, and
      know how to use tools like Git, APIs, and deployment platforms. Full stack
      developers can handle the entire web development process, from designing
      user interfaces to managing server operations, making them highly valuable
      in software development teams.

      A full stack developer is someone who can build both the front and back
      end of a website or web application. They handle everything from designing
      the user interface to writing server-side logic and managing databases.
      This means they have knowledge of multiple technologies across the entire
      development process, making them flexible and efficient in building
      complete digital solutions.

    <h3>Lets divide full stack into three parts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Frontend</li>
      <li>Backend</li>
      <li>Database</li>
    </ul>
